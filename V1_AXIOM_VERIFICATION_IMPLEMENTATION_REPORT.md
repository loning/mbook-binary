## Key Features Implemented

### 1. A1 Axiom Consistency Framework

The system verifies that the A1 axiom "self-referential complete systems must increase entropy" is:
- **Syntactically Well-Formed**: Proper logical syntax validation
- **Semantically Meaningful**: All terms precisely defined
- **Logically Consistent**: No internal contradictions
- **Mathematically Sound**: Valid mathematical relationships

### 2. Five-Fold Equivalence Verification

Automated verification of the logical equivalence chain:
```
E1 (Entropy Increase) ⟺ E2 (Time Irreversibility) ⟺ E3 (Observer Emergence) ⟺ E4 (Structural Asymmetry) ⟺ E5 (Recursive Unfolding)
```

Each equivalence is tested with dedicated algorithms that verify:
- Individual property satisfaction
- Circular implication chain completeness
- Mathematical consistency across transformations

### 3. Contradiction Detection Mechanisms

Three-tier contradiction detection system:
- **Direct Contradictions**: Logical form `P ∧ ¬P`
- **Semantic Contradictions**: Meaning-level inconsistencies
- **Mathematical Contradictions**: Computational inconsistencies

### 4. φ-Encoding Verification Algorithms

Comprehensive validation of the φ-encoding system:
- **Zeckendorf Representation**: Validates no consecutive 1s constraint
- **Information Density**: Verifies optimal `log₂(φ) ≈ 0.694` bits/symbol
- **Conservation Properties**: Ensures information preservation
- **Invertibility**: Guarantees encoding-decoding consistency
