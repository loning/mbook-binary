## Mathematical Foundation

### Axioms and Prerequisites

**Required Axioms:**
- A1: Self-referential complete systems necessarily increase entropy
- No-11 Constraint: No consecutive "11" in Zeckendorf representation

**Required Definitions:**
- D1.11: Spacetime encoding function
- D1.15: Self-reference depth
- L1.14: Entropy flow topology preservation
- T7.4: φ-computational complexity unification
- T7.5: Recursive depth computation

### Primary Mathematical Objects

**Definition 1 (φ-Spacetime Manifold):**
```
M_φ := (M^4, g_φ, Z_φ, H_φ)
```
where:
- M^4 is a 4-dimensional differentiable manifold
- g_φ is the φ-metric tensor
- Z_φ: M^4 → Z_φ is the Zeckendorf coordinate map
- H_φ: M^4 → R+ is the entropy density function

**Definition 2 (Causal Structure):**
```
C_φ := (J^+, J^-, ≺_Z, ∇H)
```
where:
- J^+(p) = {q ∈ M_φ : ∃ future-directed causal curve from p to q}
- J^-(p) = {q ∈ M_φ : ∃ past-directed causal curve from q to p}
- ≺_Z is the Zeckendorf partial order
- ∇H is the entropy gradient vector field

## Core Theorems

### Theorem 1: Entropy-Causality Equivalence

**Statement:**
For events p, q ∈ M_φ, the following are equivalent:
1. q ∈ J^+(p) (causal relation)
2. H(q) > H(p) (entropy increase)
3. p ≺_Z q (Zeckendorf order)

**Proof Structure:**
```
(1) ⟹ (2): By causal curve integration
(2) ⟹ (3): By Zeckendorf decomposition uniqueness
(3) ⟹ (1): By φ-geodesic construction
```

**Formal Proof:**

**(1) ⟹ (2):**
Let γ: [0,1] → M_φ be a future-directed causal curve with γ(0) = p, γ(1) = q.
```
H(q) - H(p) = ∫_γ ∇H · dγ = ∫_0^1 g_φ(∇H, γ̇) dt
```
Since γ is future-directed and causal:
```
g_φ(γ̇, γ̇) ≤ 0 and γ̇^0 > 0
```
By the entropy gradient condition:
```
g_φ(∇H, γ̇) = φ · γ̇^μ ∂_μ H > 0
```
Therefore H(q) > H(p).

**(2) ⟹ (3):**
Given H(q) > H(p), let ΔH = H(q) - H(p) > 0.
By Zeckendorf's theorem:
```
ΔH = ∑_{i∈I} F_i where I satisfies No-11
```
Define:
```
Z(q) = Z(p) ⊕_φ Z(ΔH)
```
where ⊕_φ is Zeckendorf addition preserving No-11.
This establishes p ≺_Z q.

**(3) ⟹ (1):**
Given p ≺_Z q, construct the piecewise φ-geodesic:
```
γ = ⋃_{i∈I} γ_i
```
where each γ_i advances along F_i direction.
By No-11 constraint, segments don't overlap, forming a valid causal curve. □

### Theorem 2: No-11 Light Cone Geometry

**Statement:**
The No-11 constraint induces an effective light speed:
```
c_φ = φ · c_0 = ((1 + √5)/2) · c_0
```

**Proof:**
Consider light-like geodesics in Zeckendorf coordinates.
For maximal propagation speed, use Fibonacci intervals:
```
Δx = F_n, Δt = F_{n-1}
```
Taking the limit:
```
v_max = lim_{n→∞} F_n/F_{n-1} = φ
```
Therefore c_φ = φ · c_0. □

### Theorem 3: Causal Phase Transitions

**Statement:**
The causal structure undergoes topological phase transitions at critical self-reference depths:

1. **D_self = 5:** Tree-like → Graph-like causality
```
π_1(M_φ^{D<5}) = 0 → π_1(M_φ^{D≥5}) = Z
```

2. **D_self = 10:** Local → Non-local causality
```
H_2(M_φ^{D<10}) = 0 → H_2(M_φ^{D≥10}) ≠ 0
```

3. **D_self = φ^10 ≈ 122.99:** Deterministic → Probabilistic causality
```
Causality_{D<φ^{10}} ∈ P_φ → Causality_{D≥φ^{10}} ∈ NP_φ
```

**Proof:**
Using results from L1.14 on entropy flow topology:

For each transition, compute the topological invariants:
```
χ(M_φ^D) = ∑_{k=0}^4 (-1)^k b_k(D)
```
where b_k(D) are Betti numbers depending on D_self.

At D = 5: First homology group becomes non-trivial
At D = 10: Second homology group becomes non-trivial  
At D = φ^10: Computational complexity class transition □

## Computational Algorithms

### Algorithm 1: Causal Cone Construction

**Input:** Event p ∈ M_φ, depth d ∈ N
**Output:** J^+(p, d) = {future causal cone to depth d}

```
function CONSTRUCT_CAUSAL_CONE(p, d):
    J := {p}
    frontier := {p}
    
    for level in 1 to d:
        new_frontier := ∅
        for event in frontier:
            for k in VALID_FIBONACCI_INDICES(event):
                q := ZECKENDORF_ADD(event, F_k)
                if SATISFIES_NO11(q):
                    new_frontier := new_frontier ∪ {q}
                    J := J ∪ {q}
        frontier := new_frontier
    
    return J
```

**Complexity:** O(φ^d) time, O(φ^d) space

### Algorithm 2: φ-Geodesic Computation

**Input:** Events p, q ∈ M_φ with p ≺_Z q
**Output:** Geodesic path γ from p to q

```
function COMPUTE_PHI_GEODESIC(p, q):
    δ := ZECKENDORF_SUBTRACT(q, p)
    path := [p]
    current := p
    remaining := δ
    
    while remaining > 0:
        f := LARGEST_FIBONACCI_IN(remaining)
        if VIOLATES_NO11(current, f):
            f := NEXT_SMALLER_FIBONACCI(f)
        
        current := ZECKENDORF_ADD(current, f)
        path := path + [current]
        remaining := ZECKENDORF_SUBTRACT(remaining, f)
    
    return path
```

**Complexity:** O(log_φ |q - p|) time and space

## Physical Interpretations

### Entropy Arrow Geometry

The entropy gradient field ∇H defines a flow on M_φ:
```
dX^μ/dλ = g^{μν} ∂_ν H
```

This flow satisfies:
1. **Irreversibility:** No closed orbits (except at D_self ≥ 5)
2. **Expansion:** div(∇H) = φ · R (R is scalar curvature)
3. **Stability:** Lyapunov exponents λ_i ≤ log φ

### Causal Diamond Structure

For events p, q with p ≺_Z q, the causal diamond:
```
D(p,q) := J^+(p) ∩ J^-(q)
```

Has volume:
```
Vol(D(p,q)) = (φ/4π) · |Z(q) - Z(p)|^2
```

### Information Flow Constraints

The No-11 constraint limits information flow rate:
```
dI/dt ≤ φ · A/4
```
where A is the boundary area (holographic bound with φ correction).

## Quantum Extensions

### Entangled Causality

For entangled systems, define the joint causal structure:
```
J^+_{AB}(p_A, p_B) = {(q_A, q_B) : Z(q_A) ⊕ Z(q_B) = Z(p_A) ⊕ Z(p_B) ⊕ Z(Δ)}
```

This preserves total Zeckendorf encoding while allowing individual variations.

### Causal Superposition

In quantum regime (5 ≤ D_self < φ^10):
```
|Ψ_causal⟩ = ∑_{γ ∈ Paths(p,q)} α_γ |γ⟩
```

where amplitudes satisfy:
```
α_γ = exp(iφ · S[γ]/ℏ) / √F_{|γ|}
```
