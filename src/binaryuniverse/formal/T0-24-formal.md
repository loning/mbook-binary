## Fundamental Theorems

### T24.1: Invariance Necessity Theorem
```
SelfRef(S) ∧ A1 → ∃I ≠ ∅: I ⊆ SRI
```
**Proof**:
- Self-referential completeness requires persistent identity
- Without invariances, self-reference is lost
- Therefore non-empty invariance set exists □

### T24.2: φ-Scale Invariance Theorem
```
∀x ∈ ℝ⁺: No11(Z(x)) ⟺ No11(Z(φⁿ·x))
```
**Proof**:
- Fibonacci scaling property: F_{k+n}/F_k → φⁿ
- Scaling preserves relative gaps in sequence
- No-11 pattern unchanged under φ-scaling □

### T24.3: CPT Theorem
```
∀S: [C ∘ P ∘ T](S) preserves dS/dt > 0
```
**Proof**:
- C: |1⟩ ↔ |0⟩ reverses information flow
- P: x⃗ → -x⃗ reverses spatial gradients  
- T: t → -t reverses time direction
- Combined effect: (−1)³ = −1 on each term
- But entropy has even number of factors
- Net result: dS/dt → dS/dt unchanged □
