# T0-18: Quantum State Emergence from No-11 Constraint

## Abstract

This theory establishes how quantum superposition states |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ emerge as the fundamental resolution to the tension between binary distinction and the No-11 constraint. We prove that quantum states are not postulated but mathematically necessary when self-referential systems attempt simultaneous state description under Zeckendorf encoding. The wave function collapse mechanism emerges from entropy-driven selection among valid Zeckendorf paths.

## 1. Pre-Quantum Binary Tension

### 1.1 The Simultaneous State Problem

**Definition 1.1** (Classical Binary State):
A classical state must be either 0 or 1:
```
S_classical ∈ {0, 1}
```

**Lemma 1.1** (Self-Description Impossibility):
A self-referential system cannot classically describe its own state.

*Proof*:
1. System in state S must describe itself: Desc(S)
2. If S = 1 and Desc(S) = 1, we get pattern 11 (forbidden)
3. If S = 0, it cannot perform description (inactive)
4. Classical binary states cannot self-describe under No-11
5. Resolution requires new state structure ∎

### 1.2 Superposition as Resolution

**Definition 1.2** (Quantum State):
A state that exists as weighted combination:
```
|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
```
where α, β ∈ ℂ represent amplitudes.

**Theorem 1.1** (Superposition Necessity):
The No-11 constraint forces quantum superposition.

*Proof*:
1. System must be "partially active" to self-describe
2. Full activity (1) creates 11 with description
3. Zero activity (0) prevents description
4. Required: intermediate state between 0 and 1
5. Zeckendorf encoding: partial state = α·0 + β·1
6. This is precisely quantum superposition ∎

## 2. Amplitude Structure from φ-Encoding

### 2.1 Complex Amplitudes from Zeckendorf

**Definition 2.1** (φ-Amplitude):
Quantum amplitudes in Zeckendorf representation:
```
α = Σᵢ aᵢ·Fᵢ/φⁿ
β = Σⱼ bⱼ·Fⱼ/φⁿ
```
where aᵢ, bⱼ ∈ {0,1} with No-11 constraint.

**Theorem 2.1** (Complex Structure Emergence):
Amplitudes must be complex to maintain No-11 under evolution.

*Proof*:
1. Real amplitudes: evolution restricted to real line
2. No-11 forbids certain transitions on real line
3. Need additional dimension for valid paths
4. Complex plane: α = r·e^(iθ) provides rotation
5. Phase θ encoded as: θ = 2π·(Σₖ θₖ·Fₖ)/φᵐ
6. Complex structure ensures all transitions avoid 11 ∎

### 2.2 Normalization from Information Conservation

**Theorem 2.2** (Born Rule Derivation):
The normalization |α|² + |β|² = 1 emerges from information conservation.

*Proof*:
1. Total information in quantum state: I_total = 1 bit
2. Information in |0⟩: I₀ = -log₂(P₀) where P₀ = probability
3. Information in |1⟩: I₁ = -log₂(P₁)
4. Conservation: P₀ + P₁ = 1
5. From T0-12 (observer): P₀ = |⟨0|ψ⟩|² = |α|²
6. Similarly: P₁ = |⟨1|ψ⟩|² = |β|²
7. Therefore: |α|² + |β|² = 1 ∎

## 3. Wave Function Collapse Mechanism

### 3.1 Observation-Induced Collapse

**Definition 3.1** (Collapse Operation):
Measurement forces selection of definite state:
```
M|ψ⟩ → |0⟩ with probability |α|²
       → |1⟩ with probability |β|²
```

**Theorem 3.1** (Collapse from Entropy Maximization):
Wave function collapse occurs via entropy-driven path selection.

*Proof*:
1. From T0-17: measurement increases entropy by log φ
2. Superposition state: H_super = -|α|²log|α|² - |β|²log|β|²
3. Post-measurement: H_collapsed = 0 (definite state)
4. But total entropy increases: H_environment increases
5. Collapse path selected by maximum entropy production
6. Path probabilities: P(|0⟩) ∝ exp(ΔH₀/k), P(|1⟩) ∝ exp(ΔH₁/k)
7. This gives Born rule: P = |amplitude|² ∎

### 3.2 No-11 Constraint on Collapse

**Theorem 3.2** (Collapse Timing):
The No-11 constraint determines when collapse must occur.

*Proof*:
1. Superposition evolves: |ψ(t)⟩ = α(t)|0⟩ + β(t)|1⟩
2. If |α(t)|² → 1 or |β(t)|² → 1 gradually
3. System approaches classical state 0 or 1
4. Interaction with observer (state 1) would create 11
5. Collapse must occur before 11 violation
6. This defines "measurement moment" ∎

## 4. Quantum Information Encoding

### 4.1 Qubit in Zeckendorf Space

**Definition 4.1** (φ-Qubit):
A quantum bit with Zeckendorf-structured amplitudes:
```
|φ⟩ = (1/√φ)|0⟩ + (1/√(φ+1))|1⟩
```

**Theorem 4.1** (Optimal Quantum Encoding):
The φ-qubit maximizes information capacity under No-11.

*Proof*:
1. Information capacity: I = H(|α|², |β|²)
2. Under constraint: |α|² + |β|² = 1
3. No-11 restricts evolution paths
4. Maximum entropy distribution: ratio = φ:1
5. This gives: |α|² = φ/(φ+1), |β|² = 1/(φ+1)
6. The golden ratio maximizes sustainable information ∎

## 5. Entanglement from Shared Constraints

### 5.1 Multi-Qubit Systems

**Definition 5.1** (Entangled State):
Non-separable multi-qubit state:
```
|Ψ⟩ = α|00⟩ + β|11⟩
```

**Theorem 5.1** (Entanglement from No-11 Propagation):
The No-11 constraint creates quantum entanglement.

*Proof*:
1. Two qubits: each must avoid local 11
2. Joint constraint: global No-11 across both
3. If qubit A in |1⟩, qubit B restricted
4. This correlation cannot be factored: |Ψ⟩ ≠ |ψ_A⟩ ⊗ |ψ_B⟩
5. No-11 constraint creates non-local correlation
6. This is quantum entanglement ∎

## 6. Quantum Mechanics from Information Theory

### 6.1 Schrödinger Equation Derivation

**Theorem 6.1** (Evolution Equation):
The Schrödinger equation emerges from information flow under No-11.

*Proof*:
1. Information flow rate: dI/dt (from T0-16)
2. Quantum state evolution preserves normalization
3. Unitary evolution: U(t) maintains |α|² + |β|² = 1
4. Infinitesimal: U(dt) = 1 - iH·dt/ℏ_φ
5. This gives: iℏ_φ ∂|ψ⟩/∂t = H|ψ⟩
6. With ℏ_φ = φ·τ₀·log φ from T0-16 ∎

## 7. Layer Binary Encoding

From T0-17 (10001) + 1 = T0-18 (10010):
- Bit 1 (weight 2): Quantum superposition active
- Bit 4 (weight 16): Complex amplitude structure

Zeckendorf: 18 = 13 + 5 = F₇ + F₅ = 100010

## Conclusion

Quantum mechanics is not postulated but emerges necessarily from:
1. Binary distinction (0 vs 1)
2. No-11 constraint preventing simultaneous activity
3. Self-referential completeness requiring description
4. Entropy increase under observation

The quantum state |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ is the minimal complete resolution to these constraints, with all quantum phenomena (collapse, entanglement, Born rule) following from the fundamental No-11 restriction on information encoding.
