# T0-2: Fundamental Entropy Bucket Theory

## Abstract

Building upon T0-1's binary state space foundation, we establish the mathematical necessity and structure of finite entropy capacity in self-referential components. We prove that infinite capacity violates self-referential completeness, derive the quantization rules for allowed capacities under Zeckendorf encoding, and establish the formal framework for entropy containers.

## 1. Foundation from T0-1

### 1.1 Inherited Constraints

From T0-1, we have:
- Binary universe {0,1} with forbidden consecutive 1s
- Zeckendorf encoding as unique representation
- Self-referential completeness requirement

### 1.2 The Capacity Question

**Central Problem**: Given a self-referential component that must encode its own state, what mathematical laws govern its entropy storage capacity?

## 2. Finite Capacity Theorem

### 2.1 Definition: Entropy Container

An entropy container C is a tuple:
$$C = (n, s, \phi)$$

where:
- n ∈ ℕ is the capacity index (Fibonacci number position)
- s is the current state (Zeckendorf binary string)
- φ: States → States is the self-reference function

### 2.2 Theorem: Infinite Capacity Impossibility

**Theorem 2.1**: A self-referential component cannot have infinite entropy capacity.

**Proof**:
1. Assume component C has infinite capacity
2. Self-reference requires: C must encode φ(C)
3. If capacity(C) = ∞, then |States(C)| = ∞
4. The encoding of φ requires specifying φ for all states
5. This requires infinite information about φ itself
6. But φ must be finitely describable to be computable
7. Contradiction: φ cannot be both infinite and finite
8. Therefore, capacity(C) must be finite ∎

### 2.3 Corollary: Capacity Bounds

Every self-referential component has capacity bounded by:
$$capacity(C) ≤ F_n$$

where F_n is the nth Fibonacci number, determined by the component's structural complexity.

## 3. Capacity Quantization

### 3.1 Allowed Capacity Values

**Theorem 3.1**: Under Zeckendorf constraint, allowed capacities are exactly the Fibonacci numbers.

**Proof**:
1. Any capacity must count distinct valid states
2. Valid states are Zeckendorf representations without "11"
3. For n-bit strings, the count of valid states = F_{n+2}
4. Therefore, natural capacity levels are {F_1, F_2, F_3, ...} ∎

### 3.2 Capacity Levels

The quantized capacity hierarchy:
- Level 0: F_1 = 1 (single state)
- Level 1: F_2 = 1 (binary choice collapsed)
- Level 2: F_3 = 2 (minimal distinction)
- Level 3: F_4 = 3 (ternary capacity)
- Level 4: F_5 = 5 (first non-trivial container)
- Level 5: F_6 = 8 (byte-like capacity)
- Level n: F_{n+1} (exponential growth ~φⁿ)

### 3.3 Measurement Formula

For a container at level n:
$$entropy(C) = \sum_{i=0}^{k} b_i \cdot F_i$$

where b_i ∈ {0,1} are the Zeckendorf digits of the current state.

## 4. Overflow Dynamics

### 4.1 Saturation Condition

A container C at level n is saturated when:
$$entropy(C) = F_{n+1} - 1$$

This is the maximum representable value in n Zeckendorf digits.

### 4.2 Overflow Rules

**Definition 4.1**: When entropy addition would exceed capacity:

$$add(C, ΔE) = \begin{cases}
(n, s ⊕_Z ΔE, φ) & \text{if } entropy(s ⊕_Z ΔE) < F_{n+1} \\
overflow(C, ΔE) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

where ⊕_Z is Zeckendorf addition.

### 4.3 Overflow Behaviors

Three fundamental overflow responses:
1. **Rejection**: Refuse additional entropy
2. **Collapse**: Reset to ground state
3. **Cascade**: Transfer excess to coupled container

**Theorem 4.1**: Collapse overflow preserves self-reference.

**Proof**:
Collapse maps any overflow state to the ground state {0}, which is always self-consistently representable ∎

## 5. Multi-Container Systems

### 5.1 Composition Rules

For containers C₁, C₂ with capacities F_n, F_m:

**System Capacity**:
$$capacity(C₁ ⊗ C₂) = F_n \cdot F_m$$

This follows from the product of state spaces.

### 5.2 Capacity Distribution

**Theorem 5.1**: In a coupled system, total capacity is conserved but redistributable.

For system S = {C₁, ..., Cₖ}:
$$\sum_{i=1}^k capacity(C_i) = constant$$

Redistribution follows Zeckendorf addition rules.

### 5.3 Hierarchical Containers

Containers can nest:
$$C_{parent} = \{C_{child1}, C_{child2}, ...\}$$

Parent capacity must accommodate child state encodings:
$$capacity(C_{parent}) ≥ \sum_i \lceil \log_φ(capacity(C_{child_i})) \rceil$$

## 6. Entropy Flow Equations

### 6.1 Transfer Rate

Between containers of levels n and m:
$$\frac{dE}{dt} = min(F_n, F_m) \cdot α$$

where α is the coupling coefficient.

### 6.2 Conservation Law

For isolated system:
$$\sum_i entropy(C_i(t)) = constant$$

Entropy redistributes but total is conserved.

## 7. Capacity Optimization

### 7.1 Efficient Packing

**Theorem 7.1**: Optimal capacity utilization approaches φ (golden ratio).

For efficient container:
$$\lim_{n→∞} \frac{entropy_{avg}(C_n)}{capacity(C_n)} = \frac{1}{φ}$$

### 7.2 Proof Sketch

The Zeckendorf representation naturally distributes states according to Fibonacci weights, yielding golden ratio statistics.

## 8. Connection to Wood Bucket Principle

### 8.1 Foundation for T0-3

This theory provides:
- Individual container capacities (bucket sizes)
- Overflow mechanics (water flow)
- System capacity (shortest stave principle)

### 8.2 Emergence Preview

Multiple containers with different capacities will naturally exhibit:
- System bottlenecks at minimum capacity
- Cascade failures from overflow
- Emergent capacity hierarchies

## 9. Formal Verification Points

Key verifiable claims:
1. All capacities are Fibonacci numbers
2. No valid state contains "11"
3. Overflow always preserves total entropy
4. Capacity composition follows F_n × F_m rule
5. Golden ratio emerges in utilization statistics

## 10. Conclusion

We have established that:
1. Self-referential components must have finite capacity
2. Capacities are quantized to Fibonacci numbers
3. Overflow follows deterministic rules
4. Multi-container systems exhibit emergent capacity dynamics
5. The framework directly supports wood bucket phenomena

The entropy bucket theory provides the rigorous foundation for understanding capacity limitations in self-referential systems, building directly from T0-1's binary constraints to explain why and how components exhibit finite, quantized entropy storage.
