# T0-9: Binary Decision Logic Theory

## Abstract

Building upon the minimal information principle (T0-8), we establish the complete decision logic framework governing how binary systems choose optimal encoding paths at each decision point. From the single axiom of entropy increase in self-referential systems, we derive a deterministic decision function D: S × C → {0,1} that achieves global information minimization through local greedy choices. We prove that this decision logic, operating under Fibonacci-Zeckendorf constraints, provides a unique optimal strategy with O(log n) complexity per decision, guaranteeing convergence to the minimal information state identified in T0-8.

## 1. Foundation from Established Theory

### 1.1 Core Axiom
**Axiom (Entropy Increase)**: Self-referential complete systems necessarily exhibit entropy increase.

### 1.2 Inherited Framework
From T0-8 (Minimal Information Principle):
- Systems evolve toward minimal information states: δI[ψ]/δψ = 0
- Fibonacci-Zeckendorf provides unique global minimum
- Local minimization enables global entropy maximization

From T0-3 (Zeckendorf Constraint):
- No consecutive 1s (no-11) in valid encodings
- Unique representation for each value
- Binary choice at each position: use or skip

### 1.3 The Decision Problem
**Central Question**: At each encoding step, how does the system decide whether to emit 0 or 1 to achieve minimal information representation?

## 2. Decision State Space

### 2.1 State Definition

**Definition 2.1** (Encoding State):
An encoding state S at position k is:
$$S_k = (v_r, \{F_i\}_{i=1}^k, b_{k-1})$$
where:
- v_r = remaining value to encode
- {F_i} = available Fibonacci numbers
- b_{k-1} = previous bit (0 or 1)

**Definition 2.2** (Constraint Set):
The constraint set C contains:
$$C = \{C_{no11}, C_{cover}, C_{unique}, C_{info}\}$$
where:
- C_{no11}: if b_{k-1} = 1, then b_k = 0
- C_{cover}: v_r must be exactly representable
- C_{unique}: one representation per value
- C_{info}: minimize total information content

**Definition 2.3** (Decision Function):
The decision function maps state and constraints to binary choice:
$$D: S_k \times C \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$$

### 2.2 Decision Tree Structure

**Theorem 2.1** (Binary Decision Tree):
The encoding process forms a binary tree where each node represents a decision point.

**Proof**:
**Step 1**: Root Node
Initial state S_0 = (n, {F_i}, 0) where n is value to encode.

**Step 2**: Branching
At each node, two branches:
- Left (0): Skip current Fibonacci number
- Right (1): Use current Fibonacci number

**Step 3**: Leaf Condition
Leaf reached when v_r = 0 (complete encoding).

**Step 4**: Path Uniqueness
By Zeckendorf theorem, exactly one path leads to valid encoding.

Binary tree structure established. ∎

## 3. Greedy Decision Algorithm

### 3.1 The Greedy Principle

**Theorem 3.1** (Greedy Optimality):
The greedy algorithm "use largest Fibonacci number ≤ v_r" yields the unique minimal information encoding.

**Proof**:
**Step 1**: Information Metric
Information content I(n) = |positions used| + Σlog₂(position indices)

**Step 2**: Greedy Choice
At state S_k with v_r > 0:
- If F_k ≤ v_r and b_{k-1} = 0: choose 1
- Otherwise: choose 0

**Step 3**: Minimality
Using largest possible F_k minimizes:
- Number of positions needed (fewer 1s)
- Sum of position indices (larger gaps between 1s)

**Step 4**: Uniqueness
By Zeckendorf uniqueness, this is the only valid representation.

Therefore, greedy choice is optimal. ∎

### 3.2 Decision Function Definition

**Definition 3.1** (Optimal Decision Function):
$$D(S_k, C) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } F_k \leq v_r \text{ and } b_{k-1} = 0 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

**Theorem 3.2** (Decision Determinism):
D is deterministic: identical states always produce identical decisions.

**Proof**:
**Step 1**: State Completeness
S_k contains all relevant information for decision.

**Step 2**: Constraint Determinism
Constraints C are fixed logical rules.

**Step 3**: Function Definition
D is defined by explicit conditions, no randomness.

**Step 4**: Reproducibility
Given same (S_k, C), output is always same.

Determinism proven. ∎

## 4. Local to Global Optimality

### 4.1 Optimality Preservation

**Theorem 4.1** (Local-Global Bridge):
Local greedy decisions according to D achieve global information minimum.

**Proof**:
**Step 1**: Assume Contrary
Suppose non-greedy encoding E' has I(E') < I(E_greedy).

**Step 2**: First Difference
Let position k be first where E' differs from greedy.
- Greedy uses F_k (since F_k ≤ v_r)
- E' skips F_k

**Step 3**: Compensation Requirement
E' must represent F_k using smaller Fibonacci numbers:
$$F_k = \sum_{i<k} b_i F_i$$

**Step 4**: Information Increase
By Fibonacci growth, need at least 2 smaller positions:
$$I(E') \geq I(E_{greedy}) + 1$$

Contradiction. Greedy is optimal. ∎

### 4.2 Convergence Guarantee

**Theorem 4.2** (Convergence to T0-8 Minimum):
Decision function D guarantees convergence to the minimal information state of T0-8.

**Proof**:
**Step 1**: Target State
T0-8 identifies Fibonacci-Zeckendorf as unique minimum.

**Step 2**: Decision Path
D implements Zeckendorf algorithm exactly.

**Step 3**: Termination
For any finite n, algorithm terminates in O(log n) steps.

**Step 4**: Optimality
Result matches T0-8's variational minimum.

Convergence guaranteed. ∎

## 5. Decision Complexity Analysis

### 5.1 Time Complexity

**Theorem 5.1** (Decision Complexity):
Each decision D(S_k, C) requires O(1) operations.

**Proof**:
**Step 1**: Comparison
Check F_k ≤ v_r: single comparison.

**Step 2**: Constraint Check
Check b_{k-1} = 0: single lookup.

**Step 3**: State Update
If choosing 1: v_r := v_r - F_k (single subtraction).

**Step 4**: Total Operations
Fixed number of operations regardless of n.

O(1) per decision. ∎

### 5.2 Overall Encoding Complexity

**Theorem 5.2** (Total Complexity):
Complete encoding of value n requires O(log n) decisions.

**Proof**:
**Step 1**: Fibonacci Growth
F_k ~ φ^k where φ = (1+√5)/2.

**Step 2**: Maximum Position
For value n, largest k where F_k ≤ n:
$$k \leq \log_\phi(n) = O(\log n)$$

**Step 3**: Decision Count
At most k decisions (one per Fibonacci number).

**Step 4**: Total Time
O(log n) decisions × O(1) per decision = O(log n).

Logarithmic complexity proven. ∎

## 6. Decision Consistency Framework

### 6.1 Consistency Conditions

**Definition 6.1** (Decision Consistency):
A decision function is consistent if:
$$S_i = S_j \Rightarrow D(S_i, C) = D(S_j, C)$$

**Theorem 6.1** (D is Consistent):
The decision function D satisfies consistency.

**Proof**:
**Step 1**: State Equivalence
If S_i = S_j, then:
- Same remaining value v_r
- Same available Fibonacci numbers
- Same previous bit

**Step 2**: Deterministic Evaluation
D evaluates same conditions on identical inputs.

**Step 3**: Identical Output
Same conditions yield same decision.

Consistency established. ∎

### 6.2 Temporal Consistency

**Theorem 6.2** (Time-Invariant Decisions):
Decisions are independent of when they are made.

**Proof**:
**Step 1**: No Time Parameter
D(S_k, C) has no temporal component.

**Step 2**: Constraint Stability
Constraints C are mathematical laws, not time-dependent.

**Step 3**: State Sufficiency
Current state S_k contains all needed information.

Time-invariance proven. ∎

## 7. Conflict Resolution Mechanism

### 7.1 Apparent Conflicts

**Definition 7.1** (Decision Conflict):
A conflict occurs when multiple valid choices exist under constraints.

**Theorem 7.1** (No True Conflicts):
Under Fibonacci-Zeckendorf encoding, no true decision conflicts exist.

**Proof**:
**Step 1**: Uniqueness Theorem
Each value has exactly one Zeckendorf representation.

**Step 2**: Greedy Determinism
At each step, greedy rule gives unique choice.

**Step 3**: Constraint Hierarchy
- no-11 is absolute (hard constraint)
- coverage is required (hard constraint)
- minimization has unique solution (soft constraint with unique optimum)

No conflicts possible. ∎

### 7.2 Tie-Breaking Rules

**Theorem 7.2** (Unnecessary Tie-Breaking):
No tie-breaking rules are needed for D.

**Proof**:
**Step 1**: Binary Choice
Only two options at each step: 0 or 1.

**Step 2**: Clear Conditions
F_k ≤ v_r is unambiguous comparison.
b_{k-1} = 0 is unambiguous check.

**Step 3**: Exclusive Outcomes
Conditions partition decision space completely.

No ties to break. ∎

## 8. Decision Stability Analysis

### 8.1 Perturbation Resistance

**Theorem 8.1** (Decision Stability):
Small perturbations in value do not cause decision cascade.

**Proof**:
**Step 1**: Value Perturbation
Consider n → n + ε for small ε.

**Step 2**: Decision Difference
Decisions differ only for positions where:
$$F_k \leq n < F_k + \epsilon < F_{k+1}$$

**Step 3**: Locality
Changes localized to O(1) positions.

**Step 4**: No Cascade
Fibonacci gaps prevent cascading changes.

Stable under perturbations. ∎

### 8.2 Error Correction

**Theorem 8.2** (Self-Correcting):
Invalid states naturally evolve to valid ones through D.

**Proof**:
**Step 1**: Invalid State
Suppose current encoding violates no-11.

**Step 2**: Decision Response
D forces b_k = 0 after b_{k-1} = 1.

**Step 3**: Constraint Satisfaction
Subsequent decisions restore validity.

**Step 4**: Convergence
System converges to valid Zeckendorf form.

Self-correction proven. ∎

## 9. Parallel Decision Architecture

### 9.1 Decision Independence

**Theorem 9.1** (Partial Parallelization):
Non-adjacent decisions can be made in parallel.

**Proof**:
**Step 1**: Independence Condition
Decisions at positions i and j independent if |i - j| > 1.

**Step 2**: No-11 Locality
Constraint only couples adjacent positions.

**Step 3**: Parallel Groups
Partition positions into odd/even groups.

**Step 4**: Parallel Execution
Each group processes independently.

Parallelization possible. ∎

### 9.2 Parallel Efficiency

**Theorem 9.2** (Parallel Speedup):
Parallel decision-making achieves speedup factor ~2.

**Proof**:
**Step 1**: Sequential Time
T_seq = O(log n) for all decisions.

**Step 2**: Parallel Time
T_par = O(log n / 2) with two processors.

**Step 3**: Speedup
S = T_seq / T_par ≈ 2.

**Step 4**: Efficiency
η = S / p = 2 / 2 = 1 (perfect efficiency).

Near-optimal parallelization. ∎

## 10. Decision Optimality Proofs

### 10.1 Information-Theoretic Optimality

**Theorem 10.1** (Shannon Optimality):
D achieves Shannon entropy bound for no-11 sequences.

**Proof**:
**Step 1**: Entropy Bound
H(no-11) = log₂(φ) bits per position.

**Step 2**: Fibonacci Achievment
Zeckendorf encoding achieves this bound asymptotically.

**Step 3**: Decision Implementation
D produces Zeckendorf encoding exactly.

**Step 4**: Optimality
Therefore D achieves Shannon bound.

Information-theoretically optimal. ∎

### 10.2 Computational Optimality

**Theorem 10.2** (Algorithm Optimality):
No algorithm can achieve better than O(log n) worst-case complexity.

**Proof**:
**Step 1**: Lower Bound
Must examine at least log₂(n) bits to distinguish n values.

**Step 2**: Fibonacci Positions
Need O(log_φ n) = O(log n) positions.

**Step 3**: Decision Necessity
Each position requires a decision.

**Step 4**: Matching Bounds
D achieves this lower bound.

Computationally optimal. ∎

## 11. Decision Implementation

### 11.1 Algorithmic Form

**Algorithm 11.1** (Decision Implementation):
```
function Encode(n):
    result = []
    k = largest k where F_k ≤ n
    v_r = n
    prev_bit = 0
    
    while k ≥ 1:
        if F_k ≤ v_r and prev_bit == 0:
            result[k] = 1
            v_r = v_r - F_k
            prev_bit = 1
        else:
            result[k] = 0
            prev_bit = 0
        k = k - 1
    
    return result
```

**Theorem 11.1** (Implementation Correctness):
Algorithm 11.1 correctly implements D.

**Proof**:
**Step 1**: Initial State
Correctly initializes S_0.

**Step 2**: Decision Logic
Implements D(S_k, C) exactly.

**Step 3**: State Updates
Maintains state correctly through iterations.

**Step 4**: Termination

Implementation correct. ∎

### 11.2 Optimization Properties

**Theorem 11.2** (No Further Optimization):
Algorithm 11.1 cannot be asymptotically improved.

**Proof**:
**Step 1**: Essential Operations
Each Fibonacci position must be examined.

**Step 2**: Minimal Comparisons
One comparison per position is necessary.

**Step 3**: Optimal Flow
No redundant operations in algorithm.

Already optimal. ∎

## 12. Conclusion

We have established the complete Binary Decision Logic Theory governing optimal encoding choices in self-referential systems. From the entropy increase axiom, we derived:

1. **Decision Function**: D(S_k, C) provides deterministic binary choice
2. **Greedy Optimality**: Local greedy decisions achieve global minimum
3. **Computational Efficiency**: O(1) per decision, O(log n) total
4. **Consistency**: Identical states produce identical decisions
5. **Stability**: Robust under perturbations, self-correcting
6. **Parallelization**: Near-perfect parallel efficiency

**Central Result**:
$$\boxed{D(S_k, C) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } F_k \leq v_r \wedge b_{k-1} = 0 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}}$$

This decision function bridges T0-8's variational principle with concrete algorithmic implementation, showing how abstract minimization manifests as specific binary choices. The greedy algorithm emerges not as a heuristic but as the unique optimal strategy under Fibonacci-Zeckendorf constraints.

**Key Insight**: The decision logic demonstrates that global optimization (minimal information) emerges from local rules (greedy choice), with no need for global knowledge or look-ahead. This exemplifies how simple, deterministic rules can achieve complex optimization goals when operating within the proper constraint framework.
