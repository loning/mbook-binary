# T0-25: Phase Transition Critical Theory

## Core Principle

Phase transitions emerge from discontinuous entropy jumps in self-referential complete systems under the No-11 constraint, with critical phenomena characterized by φ-scaled universal exponents.

## Theoretical Foundation

### 1. Entropy Jump Mechanism

**Definition 1.1** (Phase Transition):
A phase transition occurs when the entropy functional H[S] exhibits a discontinuity or non-analyticity:
```
lim_{ε→0⁺} H[S(T+ε)] - lim_{ε→0⁻} H[S(T-ε)] = ΔH ≠ 0
```

**Theorem 1.1** (Entropy Jump from No-11):
Under the No-11 constraint, entropy increases occur in discrete Fibonacci-quantized jumps:
```
ΔH = log φ · F_n
```
where F_n is the n-th Fibonacci number.

*Proof*:
1. From A1: Self-referential complete systems must increase entropy
2. No-11 constraint prevents gradual accumulation (would create "11" patterns)
3. Valid jumps must follow Zeckendorf spacing: F_n units
4. Entropy quantum: ΔH_min = log φ (smallest valid jump)
5. General jumps: ΔH = log φ · F_n ∎

### 2. Critical Point Structure

**Definition 2.1** (φ-Critical Temperature):
The critical temperature follows φ-scaling:
```
T_c = T_0 · φ^n
```
where n determines the universality class.

**Theorem 2.1** (Critical Point Uniqueness):
For each symmetry-breaking pattern G → H, there exists a unique critical point T_c where:
```
∂²G/∂T² → ∞ (second-order)
∂G/∂T discontinuous (first-order)
```

*Proof*:
1. Free energy G must respect No-11 constraint
2. Near T_c, fluctuations maximize: ξ → ∞
3. No-11 prevents multiple simultaneous transitions
4. Uniqueness follows from entropy maximization ∎

### 3. Order Parameter Dynamics

**Definition 3.1** (Zeckendorf Order Parameter):
The order parameter ψ follows Zeckendorf decomposition:
```
ψ(T) = Σ_i a_i(T) · F_i
```
where a_i ∈ {0,1} with no consecutive 1s.

**Theorem 3.1** (Order Parameter Scaling):
Near T_c, the order parameter scales as:
```
ψ ~ |T - T_c|^β, β = log₂(φ) ≈ 0.694
```

*Proof*:
1. Near criticality, ψ must vanish continuously
2. No-11 constraint restricts possible exponents
3. Self-similarity requires: ψ(λT) = λ^β ψ(T)
4. Only β = log₂(φ) satisfies both constraints ∎

## Critical Exponents

### 4. Universal φ-Exponents

**Definition 4.1** (Critical Exponent Set):
The complete set of critical exponents in d dimensions:

```
α = 2 - d/φ        (specific heat)
β = (φ-1)/2        (order parameter)
γ = φ              (susceptibility)
δ = φ²             (critical isotherm)
ν = 1/φ            (correlation length)
η = 2 - φ          (correlation function)
```

**Theorem 4.1** (φ-Scaling Relations):
The exponents satisfy modified scaling laws:
```
α + 2β + γ = 2
β(δ - 1) = γ
dν = 2 - α
γ = ν(2 - η)
```
All relations preserve No-11 constraint.

*Proof*:
1. Start with hyperscaling: dν = 2 - α
2. Apply No-11 to correlation functions
3. Fisher scaling modified by φ-factors
4. Rushbrooke, Widom relations follow ∎

### 5. Correlation Length Divergence

**Definition 5.1** (φ-Correlation Length):
```
ξ(T) = ξ_0 · |T - T_c|^(-ν), ν = 1/φ
```

**Theorem 5.1** (Correlation Length Quantization):
The correlation length is quantized in units of Fibonacci numbers:
```
ξ(T) = l_0 · F_n(T)
```
where n(T) = ⌊log_φ|T - T_c|^(-1)⌋.

*Proof*:
1. Correlation requires information propagation
2. Information packets follow Zeckendorf encoding
3. Maximum correlation distance: F_n lattice units
4. Quantization preserves No-11 constraint ∎

## Universality Classes

### 6. φ-Universality Classification

**Definition 6.1** (Universality Class):
Systems with same symmetry G → H and dimension d belong to same φ-universality class.

**Theorem 6.1** (Universality from No-11):
The No-11 constraint reduces the infinite possible universality classes to a discrete φ-hierarchy:
```
Classes: U_n = {systems with n ∈ ValidZeckendorf}
```

*Proof*:
1. RG flow must preserve No-11
2. Fixed points restricted to Zeckendorf values
3. Only φ^n scalings allowed
4. Discrete classification emerges ∎

### 7. Renormalization Group Flow

**Definition 7.1** (φ-RG Transformation):
```
R_φ: H[S,K] → H'[S',K'] with b = φ
```

**Theorem 7.1** (RG Fixed Points):
Fixed points K* of R_φ satisfy:
```
K* = φ^m · K_0
```
for integer m preserving No-11.

*Proof*:
1. Scale transformation: b = φ (unique valid scaling)
2. Fixed point condition: R_φ(K*) = K*
3. No-11 constraint: K* must be Zeckendorf-compatible
4. Solution: K* = φ^m · K_0 ∎

## Phase Transition Types

### 8. First-Order Transitions

**Definition 8.1** (Discontinuous Jump):
First-order transitions exhibit entropy jump:
```
ΔS = L/T_c = log(φ) · F_n
```

**Theorem 8.1** (Latent Heat Quantization):
Latent heat L is quantized:
```
L = k_B T_c · log(φ) · F_n
```

*Proof*:
1. Clausius-Clapeyron: dP/dT = L/(TΔV)
2. ΔS = L/T from thermodynamics
3. No-11 requires ΔS = log(φ) · F_n
4. Therefore L = k_B T_c · log(φ) · F_n ∎

### 9. Second-Order Transitions

**Definition 9.1** (Continuous Transition):
Second-order transitions have continuous entropy but divergent susceptibility:
```
χ ~ |T - T_c|^(-γ), γ = φ
```

**Theorem 9.1** (Susceptibility Divergence):
The susceptibility diverges with φ-scaling:
```
χ(T) = χ_0 · |ε|^(-φ) · (1 + a_1|ε|^(1/φ) + ...)
```
where ε = (T - T_c)/T_c.

*Proof*:
1. Response function: χ = ∂M/∂H
2. Near T_c, fluctuations dominate
3. No-11 constrains fluctuation spectrum
4. Leading singularity: |ε|^(-φ) ∎

## Quantum Critical Phenomena

### 10. Quantum Phase Transitions

**Definition 10.1** (Quantum Critical Point):
At T = 0, transitions driven by quantum fluctuations:
```
g_c = φ^(-z), z = dynamical exponent
```

**Theorem 10.1** (Quantum-Classical Mapping):
d-dimensional quantum system maps to (d+z)-dimensional classical system with:
```
z = φ (No-11 constrained dynamics)
```

*Proof*:
1. Imaginary time τ acts as extra dimension
2. τ-direction must respect No-11
3. Dynamical scaling: ω ~ k^z
4. No-11 requires z = φ ∎

## Information-Theoretic Formulation

### 11. Critical Information Density

**Definition 11.1** (Information Divergence):
At criticality, mutual information diverges:
```
I(r) ~ log(r/a) for 2D
I(r) ~ (r/a)^(d-2) for d > 2
```

**Theorem 11.1** (Information Scaling):
The information entropy at criticality:
```
S_info = S_0 + c/6 · log(L/a)
```
where c = φ is the central charge.

*Proof*:
1. Conformal invariance at criticality
2. Central charge constrained by No-11
3. Entanglement entropy follows area law
4. Logarithmic correction with c = φ ∎

### 12. Measurement-Induced Transitions

**Definition 12.1** (Observation Transition):
Phase transition induced by measurement rate p:
```
p_c = 1/φ (optimal measurement rate)
```

**Theorem 12.1** (Measurement Criticality):
At p = p_c, system exhibits:
- Volume law → Area law entanglement transition
- Ergodic → Many-body localized transition

*Proof*:
1. Measurement collapses wavefunction (T0-19)
2. Competition: unitary evolution vs measurement
3. Critical point when rates balance
4. No-11 sets p_c = 1/φ ∎

```

## Mathematical Rigor

### 14. Formal Framework

**Definition 14.1** (Critical Manifold):
```
M_crit = {(T,g,h,...) : ∂²F/∂φ² → ∞}
```

**Theorem 14.1** (Critical Manifold Dimension):
```
dim(M_crit) = N_order - N_symmetry
```
where N_order = number of order parameters, N_symmetry = broken symmetries.

**Definition 14.2** (Scaling Function):
Near criticality, observables follow scaling form:
```
O(t,h) = |t|^α f(h/|t|^Δ)
```
where f is universal, Δ = βδ.

## Conclusion

T0-25 establishes phase transitions and critical phenomena as necessary consequences of:
1. A1 axiom requiring entropy increase
2. No-11 constraint quantizing changes
3. Self-referential completeness

All critical exponents are powers or functions of φ, reflecting the fundamental Fibonacci structure of reality. The theory unifies equilibrium and non-equilibrium transitions, classical and quantum criticality, within a single φ-based framework.

The discretization of universality classes by No-11 constraint explains why nature exhibits only specific critical behaviors, not a continuum of possibilities. Phase transitions are the universe's mechanism for discontinuous entropy increase while preserving Zeckendorf encoding integrity.
