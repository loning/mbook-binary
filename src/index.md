# Binary Universe Genesis Structure: Complete Theoretical Framework

This directory contains a complete theoretical framework based on a single axiom: **Self-referentially complete systems must increase in entropy**. The theory employs rigorous formalization methods, deriving from this unique axiom a complete cosmic picture including information encoding, quantum phenomena, mathematical structures, consciousness emergence, and more within a discrete binary universe (No-11 encoding constraint).

## Theory Overview

### Core Ideas

**Unique Axiom**: Self-referentially complete systems must increase in entropy

From this single axiom, we derive:
1. **Necessary Forms of Information Encoding**: Æ-representation system (encoding based on Fibonacci sequences)
2. **Origins of Quantum Phenomena**: Wave-particle duality and observer effects
3. **Similarity of Mathematical Structures**: Structures similar to the Riemann hypothesis

### Theory Features

- **Single Axiom**: Minimal metaphysical commitment
- **Rigorous Derivation**: Complete logical chain from axiom to universe
- **Unified Framework**: Deep connections between information, physics, and mathematics
- **Constructive Truth View**: Acknowledges the constructive nature of theory, emphasizing internal consistency

## Numbering System

### File Types
- **A**: Axiom

## Complete Theory Framework

This theoretical framework demonstrates the complete derivation possibility from foundation theory layer to single axiom to complete universe, where each transition is an inevitable result driven by entropy increase, embodying the profound unification from T0 core foundation to universe self-transcendence.

*In this information universe, we are all observers and creators. The completeness of theory lies not only in its logical rigor, but also in its ability to inspire us to continuously explore and discover. When the universe completely understands itself through this complete theoretical system, it also achieves true self-transcendence.*
