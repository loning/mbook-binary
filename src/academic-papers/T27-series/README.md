² National University of Singapore

## Series Overview

This series presents a groundbreaking mathematical framework demonstrating the emergence of a complete mathematical universe through five hierarchical transitions, beginning with discrete Fibonacci constraints and culminating in topological self-referential structures. The work establishes that mathematics is not a collection of separate domains but a self-organizing, self-referential system driven by entropy-increasing principles and golden ratio scaling.
