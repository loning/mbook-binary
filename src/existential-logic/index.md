# Existential Logic Structure Theory

## Theory Overview

The Existential Logic Structure Theory is a complete theoretical framework that derives fundamental existential logic structures from the A1 axiom through self-referential completeness requirements. These 29 T0-series theories constitute the universe's most foundational logical architecture, providing the fundamental basis for all higher-level phenomena.

## Core Principles

### A1 Axiom
```
Self-referentially complete systems must increase entropy
```

### Zeckendorf Constraint
```
No-11: Forbids consecutive "11" patterns
```

### φ-Encoding System
```
φ = (1+√5)/2 (Golden Ratio)
Fibonacci sequence: F₁=1, F₂=2, F₃=3, F₄=5, F₅=8, ...
```
